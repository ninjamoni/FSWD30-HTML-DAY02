	<h1>Sade - Babyfather</h1>

	<p>
		<div>
			We were waiting for the bus
		</div>
		<div>
			No one much around but us
		</div>
		<div>
			Then I see this young boy cut a look at me
		</div>
		<div>
			I'm stunned
		</div>
		<div>
			In a daze
		</div>
		<div>
			He had the whole street set ablaze
		</div>
			It's only love they say
		<div>
			Makes you feel this way
		<span>   </span>
		<div>
			She liked his eyes she wanted more
		</div>
			The baby gonna have your smile for sure
		</div>
		<div>
			He saw a lovely girl
		</div>
		<div>
			Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
		</div>
		<div>
			She saw him looking acted like she didn't care
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			That's how we knew
		</div>
		<div>
			And so love grew a flower
		</div>
		<div>
			A flower that is you
		</div>
		<br>
		<span>Chorus</span>
		<div>
			4x Your daddy know you're a flame
		<<br>
		</div>
		<div>
			Even to the angels it may sound like a lie
		</div>
		<div>
			For you child
		</div>
		<div>
			He has the troops and extra backup standing by
		</div>
		<div>
			For you child
		</div>
